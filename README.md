# Election_Analysis: County Election Audit

## Introduction
The purpose of this election audit is to help verify the election results. In addition to that we are helping find the voter turnout for each county, their overall percentage, and the highest county present. This can help us find a better distribution of our voters and how future candidates should campaign among other things. 

## Results
Here are the results that we were able to conclude:

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
    - The total number of voters that came out across all counties was 369,711.
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
    - When looking at the counties individually, Jefferson had 10.5% (38,855) of the votes, Denver had 82.8% (306,055) of the votes, and Arapohoe had 6.7% (24,801) of the votes.
* Which county had the largest number of votes?
    - Based on the information we found, Denver overwhelming was the largest turnout in this election.
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
    - When looking at the candidates, Charles Casper Stockham had 23.0% (85,213) of the votes, Diana Degette had 73.8% (272,892) of the votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane had 3.1% (11,606) of the votes.

    - Based on the information we found, Diane Degette overwhelmigly won the electio with 73.8% (272,892) of the total votes.

## Summary
Using our script we should be able to conclude election results for most if not all elections. There should be a few minor changes to the code to help it function with all csv files that contain the correct information. First of all we should create a look to check which column contains the region and condidiate. In addition to that, create a new list of region types, so that we can interchange between counties, states, cities, and any other characteristics that may be helpful. These two changes would allow us to create a ballot counter that works universally across different region types and with candidates.
